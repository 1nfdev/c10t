This is a simple GUI using Python and Tkinter.

I know Tkinter is ugly and it sucks... But it is available on the standard Python library, so this GUI works out-of-the-box on Linux and Windows and Mac (but I don't have a Mac to test).

This is what it does:
* Graphical interface to select the most common c10t options
* Runs c10t with such options
* Shows the final command-line, so it's easy to copy-paste that onto scripts
* Previews the rendered image

What it still doesn't do:
* It don't show any output from c10t
* There is no error checking when c10t runs
* There is no progress bar (the program just hangs whie c10t is running)

Possible improvements:
* Some kind of interface to select blocks
* Some kind of interface to select files/directories
* Auto-detect the correct minecraft save path on other systems
* Implement image zooming (like Google Maps) [tip: PIL.Image.resize]
