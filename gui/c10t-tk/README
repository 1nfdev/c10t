This is a simple GUI using Python and Tkinter.

I know Tkinter is ugly and it sucks... But it is available on the standard Python library, so this GUI works out-of-the-box on Linux and Windows and Mac (but I don't have a Mac to test).

The image previewing feature requires PIL (Python Imaging Library). If it is not available, the GUI will still work, the image will be saved to disk, but it won't be displayed.

How to run:
* cd to the project root dir (the one which will contain the c10t executable)
* run ./gui/c10t-gui.py
Notice: in fact, you can run the GUI from whatever directory you want, but the suggestion above will make everything work by default.

This is what it does:
* Graphical interface to select the most common c10t options
* Runs c10t with such options
* Shows the final command-line, so it's easy to copy-paste that onto scripts
* Previews the rendered image, with zoom

What it still doesn't do:
* It don't show any output from c10t
* There is no error checking when c10t runs
* There is no progress bar (the program just hangs while c10t is running)
* The program also hangs while zooming in/out the image
* It doesn't keep the current pointed position when zooming (like google maps)

Possible improvements:
* Some kind of interface to select blocks
* Some kind of interface to select files/directories
* Auto-detect the correct minecraft save path on other systems
* Use a checkbutton for threads (when off, use the built-in auto-detection) instead of the quick-and-dirty hack of selecting zero threads
* Use radiobuttons (intead of checkbuttons) for selecting the rendering mode (group by (normal, oblique, obliqueangle, isometric) (normal, night, heightmap) )
* Add support for --no-alpha and --striped-terrain
* Improve the packaging?
