ORIGINAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
You must have corona 1.0.2 lib - http://corona.sourceforge.net/
solution to install corona : http://www.spheredev.org/smforums/index.php?topic=3152.0;wap2
To install Cartograph type 'make' . Enjoy

ADDITIONAL
I've bundled corona with cartography to make it easier to compile everything, the Makefile will attempt to statically link corona

There is also a patch under corona which fixes a couple of includes which messes with the g++ compiler.

First step (build corona):

#> cd corona
#> make
#> cd ..

This will build corona with the prefix corona/usr to get a nice directory for the libraries and such.

Second step (build cartographer in the root directory)
#> make

If something goes wrong, please remember: this is a dirty hack.

Enjoy!
